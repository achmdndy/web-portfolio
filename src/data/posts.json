      "tags": ["React", "JavaScript", "Web Development"],
      "content": "React Hooks have transformed how we write React components by enabling state and side-effect management without classes. In this article, we explore the core hooks in depth:\n\n1. **useState**: Understand how useState works under the hood, including its asynchronous nature and batching behavior.\n\n```js\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0);\nuseEffect(() => {\n  document.title = `Count: ${count}`;\n}, [count]);\n```\n\nWe discuss patterns for updating state based on previous state and handling functional updates.\n\n2. **useEffect**: Dive into lifecycle replacement with useEffect, cleanup functions, dependency arrays, and common pitfalls like stale closures.\n\n3. **Custom Hooks**: Learn how to extract reusable logic with custom hooks, including a case study of a `useFetch` hook for API requests.\n\n4. **Rules of Hooks**: Explore why the rules (only call hooks at the top level and inside React functions) are critical and how React enforces them internally.\n\nAdditionally, we’ll look at how hooks interact with **concurrent rendering** and **React Server Components**.\n\nWe close with best practices for hooks in large codebases, performance optimizations with `useMemo` and `useCallback`, and when it might still be beneficial to use external state libraries."
